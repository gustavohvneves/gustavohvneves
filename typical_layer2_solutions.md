# Polygon Edge (formerly Hermez Network):

- Core Functions: Polygon Edge is a Layer 2 scaling solution that leverages Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups to process transactions off-chain, while anchoring the final state to the Solana blockchain. This allows for faster and cheaper transactions, while inheriting the security of the Solana network.
- Implementation: Polygon Edge is built using the Rust programming language and is integrated with the Solana ecosystem. It utilizes ZK-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) to batch and compress transactions before submitting them to the Solana mainnet.

# Arbitrum Nova:

- Core Functions: Arbitrum Nova is a Layer 2 solution that brings Arbitrum's Optimistic Rollup technology to the Solana network. It aims to provide scalable, low-cost, and secure smart contract execution by processing transactions off-chain and submitting batched data to the Solana blockchain.
- Implementation: Arbitrum Nova is built using the Rust programming language and is designed to be compatible with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), allowing for the seamless deployment of Solana-based decentralized applications (dApps) on the Arbitrum Nova network.

# Neon EVM:

- Core Functions: Neon EVM is a Layer 2 solution that enables the execution of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. This allows developers to bring their existing Ethereum-based dApps and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to the Solana ecosystem.
- Implementation: Neon EVM is built using Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm), and it provides a bridge between the Ethereum and Solana networks, allowing for the secure transfer of assets and the execution of EVM-based smart contracts on the Solana blockchain.

# Mango Markets:

- Core Functions: Mango Markets is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and leveraged trading platform built on the Solana blockchain. While not a traditional Layer 2 solution, Mango Markets utilizes various Layer 2 techniques, such as off-chain order matching and on-chain settlement, to achieve high transaction throughput and low fees.
- Implementation: Mango Markets is built using the Rust programming language and the Serum DEX infrastructure, which is integrated with the Solana blockchain. It leverages Solana's fast block times and low transaction costs to provide a scalable and efficient trading experience for users.

# Solana Breakpoint:

- Core Functions: Solana Breakpoint is a Layer 2 scaling solution that utilizes a technique called "Bandwidth Sharding" to increase the overall transaction throughput of the Solana network.
- Implementation: Solana Breakpoint works by splitting the Solana network into multiple shards, each with its own validator set. This allows for parallel transaction processing, reducing the load on the main Solana blockchain.

# Sealevel:

- Core Functions: Sealevel is a parallel smart contract runtime that aims to enhance the scalability and performance of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Solana network.
- Implementation: Sealevel is built into the core Solana protocol and leverages Solana's unique architecture to enable parallel execution of smart contracts, thereby improving the overall throughput and efficiency of the network.

# Wormhole:

- Core Functions: Wormhole is a cross-chain communication protocol that allows for the secure transfer of data and assets between different blockchain networks, including Solana.
- Implementation: Wormhole provides a bridge between Solana and other popular blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Terra, enabling interoperability and the cross-chain movement of digital assets.

# Chainlink Oracles:

- Core Functions: Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data and off-chain computation to Solana-based smart contracts, enabling the development of more complex and data-driven dApps.
- Implementation: Chainlink oracles are integrated with the Solana ecosystem, allowing Solana-based dApps to securely access and utilize external data sources and off-chain computational resources.

# Zeta Markets:

- Core Functions: Zeta Markets is a decentralized derivatives trading platform built on Solana. It leverages various Layer 2 techniques, such as off-chain order matching and on-chain settlement, to provide a scalable and efficient trading experience.
- Implementation: Zeta Markets is built using Rust and integrates with the Solana blockchain, allowing users to trade a variety of derivative products, including perpetual swaps and options, with low fees and high transaction throughput.

# Metaplex:

- Core Functions: Metaplex is a decentralized protocol for creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain. While not a traditional Layer 2 solution, Metaplex leverages Solana's performance to enable efficient minting, trading, and management of NFTs.
- Implementation: Metaplex is built using Rust and is deeply integrated with the Solana ecosystem, providing developers with a powerful set of tools and standards for building NFT-based applications and marketplaces.

# Nitro Protocol:

- Core Functions: Nitro Protocol is a Layer 2 scaling solution that aims to provide high-throughput, low-latency, and low-cost transactions for the Solana network. It utilizes a novel consensus mechanism called "Optimistic Rollup with Data Availability Sampling" to achieve scalability.
- Implementation: Nitro Protocol is built using Rust and is designed to be compatible with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), allowing for the seamless deployment of Solana-based dApps on the Nitro network.

# Mango DEX:

- Core Functions: Mango DEX is a decentralized exchange built on the Solana blockchain that leverages various Layer 2 techniques, such as off-chain order matching and on-chain settlement, to provide a high-performance trading experience.
- Implementation: Mango DEX is built using Rust and Serum's DEX infrastructure, which is tightly integrated with the Solana network. It provides users with a range of trading features, including spot trading, margin trading, and liquidity mining.
